To identify *uniquely*, a batch of food and the *raw* material used, in a way which allows tracking the food through the food chain to the immediate *customer* and tracing the flow of raw materials *backwards* to the immediate *supplier* e.g. from farm to fork.\n\n2. To create and maintain accurate *records* that can be provided within a short time period for routine checking as requested by the competent authorities."},"subContentId":"eea8a9f4-3905-4e42-a931-b2be1f3cc549","metadata":{"contentType":"Drag Text","license":"U","title":"Food Traceability Drag Text"}},"alwaysDisplayComments":false,"backgroundOpacity":0,"displayAsButton":false,"buttonSize":"big","goToSlideType":"specified","invisible":false,"solution":""}]},{"slideBackgroundSelector":{},"elements":[{"x":0,"y":0,"width":99.128540305010901,"height":96.774193548387089,"action":{"library":"H5P.DragText 1.8","params":{"taskDescription":"Drag the words into the correct boxes","overallFeedback":[{"from":0,"to":100}],"checkAnswer":"Check","tryAgain":"Retry","showSolution":"Show solution","dropZoneIndex":"Drop Zone @index.","empty":"Drop Zone @index is empty.","contains":"Drop Zone @index contains draggable @draggable.","ariaDraggableIndex":"@index of @count draggables.","tipLabel":"Show tip","correctText":"Correct!","incorrectText":"Incorrect!","resetDropTitle":"Reset drop","resetDropDescription":"Are you sure you want to reset this drop zone?","grabbed":"Draggable is grabbed.","cancelledDragging":"Cancelled dragging.","correctAnswer":"Correct answer:","feedbackHeader":"Feedback","behaviour":{"enableRetry":true,"enableSolutionsButton":true,"enableCheckButton":true,"instantFeedback":false},"scoreBarLabel":"You got :num out of :total points","a11yCheck":"Check the answers.

But such systems are rarely able to meet the requirements.\n\nMost traceability systems will need to use at least part of the purchase and sales systems, but changes are needed because the traceability system needs to track and trace the *physical flow* of the food rather than the commercial flow of the food, which in some cases, can be different.\n\nAlso, the traceability *system* must be able to produce *accurate* traceability records in a short period of time at the *demand* of the competent authorities.
