This will allow them to let down their *guard* a bit. Even if you cannot do anything for them, they are more likely to accept a more *reasonable* solution.\nSometimes you have to be *creative* to resolve problems and if your customer is not *satisfied*, it may be in your best interest to give a full *refund*.\nYour business does not want to be losing *money* but a situation like this should be rare and if it is not, there should be huge changes introduced to prevent these complaints. Keeping a customer *complaint* log is crucial to the continuous improvement of customer service in your shop.\nYou must make sure that the customer is *100%* satisfied. Once the problem has been resolved, you need to clarify this because if you do not, you could find out on social media at a later stage.\nTo show the *customer* that you care about them, you could *follow up* with them to see if the product or service has met their needs now and that they are *happy*. This could be an easy phone call and can ensure their repeat custom."}
