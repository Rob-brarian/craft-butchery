A good attitude towards customers means that we deal with them in a way that is *respectful*. It means that we try to give them top *priority*. It means that we will do that little bit extra to ensure they are *satisfied*. \nA good *attitude* can be defined as having a desire to exceed the *needs* and expectations of the customer. A positive attitude to customers includes trying to *help* even if it isn\u2019t their job, put the customer *first*, ask for *feedback* so that improvements can be made. \nBehaviour means the way in which you behave towards your customer. Behaviour is all about how you *act*. Positive behaviours includes being friendly, helpful and *approachable*, being attentive, being polite, being tidy and *presentable*. \nCompetence means being *capable* and effective. A competent customer service person is one who is knowledgeable about their area of responsibility and can give *sensible* and informed answers to questions. The key to being competent in your area of work is being properly *trained*."}
