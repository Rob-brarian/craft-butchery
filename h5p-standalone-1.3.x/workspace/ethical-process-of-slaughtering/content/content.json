When the carcase is opened, the caul suet covering the stomach is removed, followed by the pluck, which contains the heart, lungs and liver. Finally the stomachs and the intestines are removed for processing. The carcase is split into two sides using a power saw and the spinal cord is removed. Washing of the carcase is required to remove all visible contamination. Cooling the carcase is essential before refrigeration, as the muscles will contract if exposed to refrigeration temperature when hot. Refrigeration: Once the carcase has been cooled, it is placed at 0 degrees Celsius. This temperature must be maintained at all times during storage and processing of the meat and meat products.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n"},"library":"H5P.AdvancedText 1.1","metadata":{"contentType":"Text","license":"U","title":"Untitled Text"},"subContentId":"2d62d0fc-eeb0-4397-ab09-91b2e268613c"},"useSeparator":"auto"},{"content":{"params":{"media":{"disableImageZooming":false},"correct":"true","behaviour":{"enableRetry":true,"enableSolutionsButton":true,"enableCheckButton":true,"confirmCheckDialog":false,"confirmRetryDialog":false,"autoCheck":false},"l10n":{"trueText":"True","falseText":"False","score":"You got @score of @total points","checkAnswer":"Check","showSolutionButton":"Show solution","tryAgain":"Retry","wrongAnswerMessage":"Wrong answer","correctAnswerMessage":"Correct answer","scoreBarLabel":"You got :num out of :total points","a11yCheck":"Check the answers.
