You want your customer to feel *comfortable* enough to tell you that your product or service did not meet their *expectations*. When they do this you have an opportunity to make things right and maintain *repeat* business from that customer. \nIf a customer does not feel comfortable to tell you their *concerns*, what could happen is they tell a friend who tells a friend or they could review your business *negatively* online.\nIt is important that customers do tell us when they are *dissatisfied* so that we strive to continuously *improve* our business. The best way to deal with any customer customer complaint is to focus all your *attention* on that customer, actively listen, show concern and positively resolve their problem."}
